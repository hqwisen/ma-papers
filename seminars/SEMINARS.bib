	abstract = {Data mining can play a fundamental role in modern power systems. However, the companies in this area still face several difficulties to benefit from data mining. A major problem is to extract useful information from the currently available non-labeled digitized time series. This work focuses on automatic classification of faults in transmission lines. These faults are responsible for the majority of the disturbances and cascading blackouts. To circumvent the current lack of labeled data, the Alternative Transients Program (ATP) simulator was used to create a public comprehensive labeled dataset. Results with different preprocessing (e.g., wavelets) and learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees and neural networks) are presented, which indicate that neural networks outperform the other methods.},

The model we propose provides a complete representation of all the phases of each ﬂights, i.e., the phase of taking-oﬀ, of cruising and of landing; suggesting all the actions to be implemented to achieve the goal of safe, eﬃcient, and expeditious aircraft movement. The distinctive feature of the model is that it allows rerouting decisions. These decisions are formulated by means of “local” conditions, which allow us to represent such decisions in a very compact way by only introducing new constraints. Moreover, to strengthen the polyhedral structure of the underlying relaxation, we also present three classes of valid inequalities.},

	abstract = {Intelligent air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental challenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. FAA estimates put weather, routing decisions and airport condition induced delays at 1,682,700 h in 2007 (FAA OPSNET Data, US Department of Transportation website, http://www.faa.gov/data\_statistics/), resulting in a staggering economic loss of over \$41 billion (Joint Economic Commission Majority Staff, Your flight has been delayed again, 2008). New solutions to the flow management are needed to accommodate the threefold increase in air traffic anticipated over the next two decades. Indeed, this is a complex problem where the interactions of changing conditions (e.g., weather), conflicting priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and heavy volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace) demand an adaptive and robust solution. In this paper we explore a multiagent algorithm where agents use reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce congestion through local actions. Each agent is associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and has one of three actions: setting separation between airplanes, ordering ground delays or performing reroutes. We simulate air traffic using FACET which is an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. Our FACET simulations on both artificial and real historical data from the Chicago and New York airspaces show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 80\% over agents receiving a global reward and by up to 90\% over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation).},

	doi = {10.1016/j.trb.2008.05.011},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a stochastic integer programming model for managing air traffic inbound to an airport when both the airport itself and its approach routes are subject to adverse weather. In the model, ground delay decisions are static, while those on rerouting are dynamic. The decision variables in the model are aggregate number of flights planned to arrive at various capacity constrained resources. The model does not directly assign arrival times to individual flights. Therefore, in context of Collaborative Decision Making, which is the governing philosophy of the air traffic management system of the United States, the solutions from the dynamic rerouting model can be directly fed to some resource allocation algorithm that assigns routes and release times to individual flights or to the airlines who operate them. When adverse weather blocks or severely limits capacity of terminal approach routes, rerouting flights onto other approaches yields substantial benefits by alleviating high ground delays. Our experimental results indicate that making rerouting decisions dynamically results in 10–15\% delay cost reduction compared to static rerouting, and about 50\% less delay cost compared to a “pure” ground holding strategy (i.e., no rerouting). In contrast to static rerouting, the dynamic rerouting capability results in making rerouting decisions that are better matched to realized weather conditions. Lower total expected delay cost is achieved by delaying the rerouting decisions for flights until they reach the divergence point between alternative routes, and hence exploiting updated information on weather while making those decisions. In cases where the airport is the main, but not the only, bottleneck, the dynamic rerouting model may assign higher ground delays so that the rerouting decisions can be deferred until more information on en route weather becomes available.},

	abstract = {Big Data from Space refers to the massive spatio-temporal Earth and Space observation data collected by a variety of sensors - ranging from ground based to space-borne - and the synergy with data coming from other sources and communities. This domain is currently facing sharp development with numerous new initiatives and breakthroughs from intelligent sensors' networks to data science application. These developments are empowering new approaches and applications in various and diverse domains influencing life on earth and societal aspects, from sensing cities, monitoring human settlements and urban areas to climate change and security. The goal of the Big Data from Space conference is to bring together researchers, engineers, developers, and users in the area of Big Data from Space. It is co-organised by ESA, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, and the European Union Satellite Centre (SatCen). The 2019 edition of the conference was hosted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and held in the Alte Kongresshalle of Munich (Germany) from the 19th to the 21st of February 2019. These proceedings consist of a collection of 75 short papers accepted for oral or poster presentation at the conference as a result of the peer-review process by the conference programme committee. The papers are lined up around the topics matching the oral sessions as well as the poster session, also organised by topics. These contributions provide a snapshot of the current research activities, developments, and initiatives in Big Data from Space. This 4th edition of the Big Data from Space conference is directed towards 'Turning Data into Insights'. Indeed, while the first editions of the conference concentrated on technologies and platforms capable of sustaining the sharp increase of data streams originating from space sensors, the development of efficient and effective methodologies and algorithms capable of extracting insights from these data is gradually becoming the main challenge. In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have started to play a key role as illustrated by numerous papers of this conference edition. Methodological developments are motivated by the pressing need to extract information on large areas and/or over long time series to better understand the dynamics of the processes that are shaping our planet and indeed our universe in the case of data collected by telescopes. The topic of analysis ready data has also emerged since the last edition and is closely linked with the development of new data cube representations. Big data from space is also introducing some new legal challenges and the need for further developments of standards and interoperable interfaces between the growing number of platforms hosting multi-petabyte scale data co-located with processing capabilities. All these topics as well as other generic key aspects of big data are mirrored in dedicated sections of these proceedings.},

Deep learning techniques applied on visual content are able to infer accurate decisions about concepts and events in an automatic way, based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks which are trained on very large external image collections in order to transfer knowledge from them to the considered task. Existing emergency management services focus on the detection of flooded areas, without the possibility to infer if a road from point A to a point B is passable or not. To that end, we propose an automatic road passability service that is able to deliver the parts of the road network which are not passable, using satellite image patches. Experiments and fine-tuning on an annotated benchmark collection indicates the most suitable model among several Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.},

	abstract = {With the fast development of remote sensor technologies, e.g. the appearance of Very High Resolution (VHR) optical sensors, SAR, LiDAR, etc., mounted on either airborne or spaceborne platforms, multi-source remote sensing data fusion techniques are emerging due to the demand for new methods and algorithms. The general fusion techniques have been well developed and applied in various fields ranging from satellite earth observation to computer vision, medical image processing, defence security and so on. Despite the fast development, the techniques remain challenging for multi-source data fusion within varying spatial and temporal resolutions. This article reviews current techniques of multi-source remote sensing data fusion and discusses their future trends and challenges through the concept of hierarchical classification, i.e., pixel/data level, feature level and decision level. This article concentrates on discussing optical panchromatic and multi-spectral data fusing methods. So far, the pixel level fusion methods have mainly focused on optical data fusion; high-level fusion includes feature level and decision level fusion of multi-source data, such as synthetic aperture radar, optical images, LiDAR and other types of data. Finally, this article summarises several trends tending to broaden the application of multi-source data fusion.},
