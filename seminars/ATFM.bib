	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new Integer Program (IP) for the Air Traﬃc Flow Management (ATFM) problem. The model we propose provides a complete representation of all the phases of each ﬂights, i.e., the phase of taking-oﬀ, of cruising and of landing; suggesting all the actions to be implemented to achieve the goal of safe, eﬃcient, and expeditious aircraft movement. The distinctive feature of the model is that it allows rerouting decisions. These decisions are formulated by means of “local” conditions, which allow us to represent such decisions in a very compact way by only introducing new constraints. Moreover, to strengthen the polyhedral structure of the underlying relaxation, we also present three classes of valid inequalities.},

	abstract = {Intelligent air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental challenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. FAA estimates put weather, routing decisions and airport condition induced delays at 1,682,700 h in 2007 (FAA OPSNET Data, US Department of Transportation website, http://www.faa.gov/data\_statistics/), resulting in a staggering economic loss of over \$41 billion (Joint Economic Commission Majority Staff, Your flight has been delayed again, 2008). New solutions to the flow management are needed to accommodate the threefold increase in air traffic anticipated over the next two decades. Indeed, this is a complex problem where the interactions of changing conditions (e.g., weather), conflicting priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and heavy volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace) demand an adaptive and robust solution. In this paper we explore a multiagent algorithm where agents use reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce congestion through local actions. Each agent is associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and has one of three actions: setting separation between airplanes, ordering ground delays or performing reroutes. We simulate air traffic using FACET which is an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. Our FACET simulations on both artificial and real historical data from the Chicago and New York airspaces show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 80\% over agents receiving a global reward and by up to 90\% over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a stochastic integer programming model for managing air traffic inbound to an airport when both the airport itself and its approach routes are subject to adverse weather. In the model, ground delay decisions are static, while those on rerouting are dynamic. The decision variables in the model are aggregate number of flights planned to arrive at various capacity constrained resources. The model does not directly assign arrival times to individual flights. Therefore, in context of Collaborative Decision Making, which is the governing philosophy of the air traffic management system of the United States, the solutions from the dynamic rerouting model can be directly fed to some resource allocation algorithm that assigns routes and release times to individual flights or to the airlines who operate them. When adverse weather blocks or severely limits capacity of terminal approach routes, rerouting flights onto other approaches yields substantial benefits by alleviating high ground delays. Our experimental results indicate that making rerouting decisions dynamically results in 10–15\% delay cost reduction compared to static rerouting, and about 50\% less delay cost compared to a “pure” ground holding strategy (i.e., no rerouting). In contrast to static rerouting, the dynamic rerouting capability results in making rerouting decisions that are better matched to realized weather conditions. Lower total expected delay cost is achieved by delaying the rerouting decisions for flights until they reach the divergence point between alternative routes, and hence exploiting updated information on weather while making those decisions. In cases where the airport is the main, but not the only, bottleneck, the dynamic rerouting model may assign higher ground delays so that the rerouting decisions can be deferred until more information on en route weather becomes available.},
