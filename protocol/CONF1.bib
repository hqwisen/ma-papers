	title = {Applicability of {DUKPT} {Key} {Management} {Scheme} to {Cloud} {Wallet} and other {Mobile} {Payments}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2463},
	abstract = {After discussing the concept of DUKPT based symmetric encryption key management (e.g., for 3DES) and definition of cloud or remote wallet, the paper analyses applicability of DUKPT to different use cases like mobile banking, NFC payment using EMV contactless card and mobile based EMV card emulation, web browser based transaction and cloud or remote wallet. Cloud wallet is an emerging payment method and is gaining momentum very fast. Anticipating that the wallet product managers and security specialists may face these questions from different stakeholders, the authors have addressed applicability of DUKPT to cloud wallet use case quite elaborately. As per knowledge of the authors, this topic has been analysed and discussed for the first time.},
