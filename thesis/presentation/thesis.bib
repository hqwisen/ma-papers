	abstract = {Visibly pushdown automata (VPAs), introduced by Alur and Madhusudan in 2004, are a useful formalism in various contexts, such as expressing and checking properties on control flows of programs, or on XML documents. In this context, we propose efficient antichain-based algorithms to check universality and inclusion of VPAs. Whereas the computation complexity is known to be ExpTime-complete for both problems, we show how antichains can avoid explicit determinization and save computations. The approach is extended to hedge automata. We implement the proposed algorithms in a prototype tool and conduct experiments on randomly generated VPAs. We show that, on numerous instances, our algorithms outperform other VPA tools.},

	abstract = {Properties of intervals in the lattice of antichains of subsets of a universe of finite size are investigated. New objects and quantities in this lattice are defined. Expressions and numerical values are deduced for the number of connected antichains and the number of fully distinguishing antichains. The latter establish a connection with Stirling numbers of the second kind. Decomposition properties of intervals in the lattice of antichains are proven. A new operator allowing partitioning the full lattice in intervals derived from lower dimensional sub-lattices is introduced. Special posets underlying an interval of antichains are defined. The poset allows the derivation of a powerful formula for the size of an interval. This formula allows computing intervals in the six dimensional space. Combinatorial coefficients allowing another decomposition of the full lattice are defined. In some specific cases, related to connected components in graphs, these coefficients can be efficiently computed. This formula allows computing the size of the lattice of order 8 efficiently. This size is the number of Dedekind of order 8, the largest one known so far.},

Our aim is to simplify the interaction of tools, helping the research community to build upon other people’s work. A key feature of the format is the use of very generic acceptance conditions, specified by Boolean combinations of acceptance primitives, rather than being limited to common cases such as Büchi, Streett, or Rabin. Such flexibility in the choice of acceptance conditions can be exploited in applications, for example in probabilistic model checking, and furthermore encourages the development of acceptance-agnostic tools for automata manipulations. The format allows acceptance conditions that are either state-based or transition-based, and also supports alternating automata. Open image in new window},

While the theoretical complexities of these algorithms are known, there has not been a systematic empirical comparison between them. In this work we propose a probabilistic framework for testing the performance of automata-theoretic algorithms. We conduct a direct experimental comparison between Hopcroft’s and Brzozowski’s algorithms. We show that while Hopcroft’s algorithm has better overall performance, Brzozowski’s algorithm performs better for “high-density” NFA. We also consider the universality problem, which is traditionally solved explicitly via the subset construction. We propose an encoding that allows this problem to be solved symbolically via a model-checker. We compare the performance of this approach to that of the standard explicit algorithm, and show that the explicit approach performs significantly better.},
