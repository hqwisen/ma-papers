	title = {An {Ant} {Approach} to the {Flow} {Shop} {Problem}},
	abstract = {: In this article we present an Ant Colony Optimization approach to the Flow Shop Problem. ACO is a new algorithmic approach, inspired by the foraging behavior of real ants, that can be applied to the solution of combinatorial optimization problems. Artificial ants are used to construct solutions for Flow Shop Problems that subsequently are improved by a local search procedure. Comparisons with other heuristics for the Flow Shop Scheduling problem show that with our approach very promising results are obtained. 1 Introduction  The Flow Shop Problem (FSP) can be stated as follows: Each of n jobs 1; : : : ; n have to be processed on m machines  1; : : : ; m in that order. The processing time of job i on machine j is t ij . The processing times are fixed, nonnegative, and may be 0 if a job is not processed on some machine. Further assumptions are that each job can be processed on only one machine at a time, the operations are not preemptable, the jobs are available for processing at time ...},

	abstract = {In this article we present an application of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic to the single machine total weighted tardiness problem. First, we briefly discuss the constructive phase of ACO in which a colony of artificial ants generates a set of feasible solutions. Then, we introduce some simple but very effective local search. Last, we combine the constructive phase with local search obtaining a novel ACO algorithm that uses a heterogeneous colony of ants and is highly effective in finding the best-known solutions on all instances of a widely used set of benchmark problems.},
