Analyse Coop on 50 and compare moore and vn, y is it different ?

Explain visualization observation, explain that it drops then comeback,
whatever neighborhoods it uses

Explain difference betwee 50 and others, and explain also that to runs
are not always the same (give example for 20). Explain why coop is smaller
(and 0 for 4x4)

Part 2

Why P ?

Same as P1

what is different as in P1, why ?

Part 3


\subsection{Cooperation level over time}

\textbf{Configuration: 50, 1/2, prisoners, moore, unconditional\_imitation}

According to the plot in Figure \ref{fig:part1plot}, one can say that
the cooperation level is steady
around 89\% after round 50.

With the visualization
we can see that after the first round a big majority of the players, around
98\%, prefer to defect. This can be explained by the fact that the first
round is randomly played.
Since a matrix of size 50 is large enough,
we can say that around 50\% of players choose defect and other players
choose cooperate.

\textbf{Note: ~tX means around round X}

At round \texttt{t2}, only a few players still choose cooperate. Those players
will form a sort of \textit{cluster} that will grow at each round, until
getting to \texttt{~t50}. At this point, cooperation is the majority of players
and we can see in the visualization that defect players for small zone inside
the cooperation clusters.

\section{NOTES.md}

# Last round

last round is chosen randomly in a scale (see config)

# Idea for third part

* Instead of using one update mechanism per simulation, maybe uses multiple
update mechanism, and each player has preferences between update mechanism
to play in different situation

* Simultaneous play, chances moves etc

* Hydra jobs

# unconditional\_imitation

In our implementation, a player keep his scores if it is the better from
all of his neighbors

Should previous_score[ni, nj] > best_score or >= ?

# Part 2

apparently Pij stabilized to 0.5, why ?

coop in stab around 40%
